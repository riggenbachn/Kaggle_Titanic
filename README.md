## Project description
This repository is my solution to Kaggle's Titanic machine learning competition. Mostly this was done to practice the basic methods of machine learning and statistics I have learned.

There are 6 files, 3 csv files and 3 python files. The csv files train.csv and test.csv are the data files given to us to train and test our model, respectively. The file titanic_submission.csv is the output of our machine learning model. The file titanic_statistics.py is the python code used to run the statistical test described in [Statistical analysis](https://github.com/riggenbachn/Kaggle_Titanic/blob/main/README.md#statistical-analysis). Similarly, the file titanic_model_tester.py is the code used to test which learning parameters where best for this question as described in [Testing for optimal learning parameters](https://github.com/riggenbachn/Kaggle_Titanic/blob/main/README.md#testing-for-optimal-learning-parameters). Finally, the file Titanic.py is the python code used to generate the titanic_submission.csv file and is described in [Results](https://github.com/riggenbachn/Kaggle_Titanic/blob/main/README.md#results).
