## Project description
This repository is my solution to Kaggle's Titanic machine learning competition. Mostly this was done to practice the basic methods of machine learning and statistics I have learned.

There are 6 files, 3 csv files and 3 python files. The csv files train.csv and test.csv are the data files given to us to train and test our model, respectively. The file titanic_submission.csv is the output of our machine learning model.
